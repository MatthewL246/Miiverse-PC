# Miiverse-PC

This is a Miiverse portal client for PCs, specifically for Pretendo Juxtaposition. It also has some other useful features, such as downloading a Pretendo user's profile data.

## Installation

1. Download the [lastest release](https://github.com/MatthewL246/Miiverse-PC/releases) zip file that matches your PC's architecture.
2. Install the latest [.NET 6.0 Windows Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) for Windows.
3. Download the latest installer for the [Windows App SDK 1.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/downloads) and run it.
4. Make sure that the [Microsoft Edge WebView2 runtime](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703) is installed.
5. Extract the release zip and run the `Miiverse-PC.exe` app inside it.

*Note: Hopefully, this installation process gets simpler in the future. But for now, this is all necessary to make sure the app runs.*
